# pickwords
Python script to pick random words out of a word list

The script expects a file at `/usr/share/dict/american-english` with one word per line. Any word that contains anything other than lowercase letters is ignored. One hundred randomly chosen words are printed to standard output, separated by spaces.

## To do

* [ ] Add option to specify dictionary file
* [x] Add option to specify word count (use `-n 100`)
